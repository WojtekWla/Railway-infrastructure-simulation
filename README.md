# Railway-infrastructure-simulation using Java Swing
Project which generates connection between stations and then mapping them on the map, and allow train to travel between these stations.

#Known issues (Work in progress)
1. During the mapping process, an array out of bounds exception sometimes occurs.
2. Some stations are not placed on the map and therefore the connection indicates the beginning of the system
